# Deployment Helpers

This project holds various deployment scripts that are used with AWS CodeDeploy and releasing our private NPM modules.

## Node Apps

### `createPrivateRelease.sh`

This will check if the `package.json` version has been updated for a project and then create a new release on github after running `npm build` and commiting any changed release assets in the `dist` directory.
Steps:
 - Check credentials
 - Check we are on the release branch
 - Setup git environment
 - Check if we have not release this version already
 - Remove dist/ folder if it exists
 - Build again, to recreate the dist/ folder
 - Commit the dist/ folder if it exists
 - Tag a new release with this version
 - Delete the current tag for this major version, for example `v2.3.4`
 - Tag a new release with this major version, for example `v2-latest`
 - Optionally log to Graphite

You must have environment vars `GITHUB_USER` and `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` set. If they're missing this will fall back to `GHUSER` and `GHPASS` - we should migrate all Short Breaks CI to use this script with the correct params and then remove this option.

If you set evn var of `DEBUG` you can try out this script echoing instead of updating anything, for example
```
DEBUG=true RELEASE_BRANCH=lunchtime-larks GITHUB_USER=foo GITHUB_API_TOKEN=bar npm run release
```

#### optional params for createPrivateRelease.sh

If you pass an extra param to the release script, and the relevant related environment vars are set (`GRAPHITE_API_KEY`, `BASE_NAME`, and `GRAPHITE_ENDPOINT_PREFIX`) then we will log this to graphite. Example (with debugging):
```
DEBUG=true RELEASE_BRANCH=lunchtime-larks GITHUB_USER=foo GITHUB_API_TOKEN=bar GRAPHITE_API_KEY=graphite npm run release -- PRODUCTION
```

If you pass in a second param of true then no data will be logged to graphite. Example (with debugging):
```
DEBUG=true RELEASE_BRANCH=lunchtime-larks GITHUB_USER=foo GITHUB_API_TOKEN=bar GRAPHITE_API_KEY=graphite npm run release -- PRODUCTION true
```

### `cachedInstallModules.sh`

This can speed up installation of node modules on hosted CI. It stores a hash of the `package.json` into the node_modules directory and uses it to determine if we may need to reinstall. Alongside this, it can automatically upgrade `npm`, and wipe out the cached node_modules directory if `package.json` has changed (to ensure unused modules are removed, and that new releases satisfying the current version range are updated to).

Use and configure with package.json:

```
  "scripts": {
    "install:cached": "rm -rf ./deployment-helpers && git clone https://github.com/holidayextras/deployment-helpers.git && ./deployment-helpers/nodeApps/cachedInstallModules.sh"
  },
  "config": {
    "nodeModuleCaching": {
      // "clear", "prune" or omit.
      // "clear" is slower, but will pick up all available updates to modules
      // "prune" is faster, but will continue using already-cached modules if
      //   they still satisfy the range. Extraneous modules are removed.
      // If omitted, the usual approach of simply running `npm install` is used,
      // which will not install available updates or remove extraneous modules.
      "strategy": "clear",

      // Which npm version to install. Omit to use the existing default.
      "npmVersion": 3,

      // Increment this optional key to invalidate the current module cache, without
      // resorting to hacks like adding whitespace to the end of package.json
      "incrementToForceUpdate": 1
    }
  },
```

## Releasing to NPM

We currently use a combination of npm version 1 and above, because of this we can not scope the package name in the `package.json`, when a new NPM release is required please add the scope to the package name (`@holidayextras/deployment-helpers`) manually before running `npm publish`.
